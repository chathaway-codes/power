Description: This is a list of our project requirements in a more formal tone, taken from the board on 11/02/12. I don't know what we should do with this information exactly, but I feel like a plan can be devised from this.



First priority:
	Server:
		- Physical server
		- Stays inside building being monitored 
		- Runs a web server
		- Web server provides the Display 
		- Connects to the user's network 
		- Communicates with ZigBee Mesh
		- Does not lose data
		
	Satellites:
		- Measure current 
		- Measure voltage 
		- Interface with NEMA 5-15 standard outlets 
		- Connect to Server 
		- Are safe (do not cause fire) 
		- Support ZigBee mesh networking
		- Status lights
		- Designed to be compact
		
	Display:
		- Provides users with many ways to view data
		- Provides interface to manage Satellites
		- Designed intuitively
		
Second priority:
	Overall:
		- Designed aesthetically
	Server:
		- Consumes < 10W
		- Provides secure web server (https)
		- Offers a factory reset button
		- Controls user access to Server
		
	Satellites:
		- Have On and Off modes
		- Consume < 1W each
		
	Display:
		- Provides user management
		- Supports cost calculation for devices
		- Designed for security
		
Third priority:
	Overall:
		- Costs not lots
	Server:
		- Encrypts database
	Satellites:
		- Have relay inside to cut device power
	Display:
		- Provides control over Satellite operating modes
		- Provides a cost comparison for devices at selected times
		- Provides a way to toggle device power
		- Provides power bill estimation
		- Provides a way to change reporting frequency of Satellites
		- Supports software upgrades
		- Designed for efficient use
