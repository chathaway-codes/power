\subsection{Add-Ons}
The Server provides for the computational needs of the POW-R project; 
more hardware shall be added before the utility needs of the project are met.

\subsection{Server Hardware IO}

\subsubsection{IP Display}
The IP of the Server shall be displayed somewhere on it's casing. 
The user will enter this IP into their browser to access the Display.

This will be achieved by connecting an Arduino via USB to the Server, and housing it inside the Server's casing. 
The Arduino will be connected to an LCD display which will output the network IP of the Server. 
Figure \ref{ArduinoLCD} shows the interaction between Server and Arduino.

\end{figure}

The IP address of the system can be obtained from the operating system, and sent to the Arduino one byte at a time. 
This works well, since the Arduino connects over serial and thusly takes a byte at a time.

\subsubsection{Power Switch}
A standard rocker switch will be added to the case to provide the user with a way to turn the Server on and off. 
The style of the switch will clearly signify "On" or "Off".

\subsubsection{Factory Reset\repeatfootnote{opt}}
This button should intentionally be placed somewhere inconvenient: 
Sunken into the case far enough that you need a skinny rod (such as a paperclip) to push it, and in a spot
that chaotic forces (children, mean people, God's divine will) will not notice it.
	
\subsection{Server Hull}
The Server needs a protective casing for several reasons. 
On the physical level, a durable casing will protect the hardware. 
The casing also serves to render unnecessary ports inaccessible to users. 
Lastly, the casing shall meet client expectations of what a server looks like.

As far as prototyping goes, the casing can be as simple as a folded piece of aluminum
with holes cut in it to fit the IP display, the buttons, and any ports that must be
exposed. As an end-game product, the casing would probably be more professional and streamlined.
