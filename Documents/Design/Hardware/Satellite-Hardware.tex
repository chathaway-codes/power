\subsection{Communications Hardware}

% Describe hardware setup for our
% XBee modules

\subsubsection{XBee Series 2 Radio Modules}

% Might want to mention we want series 2 for
% Zigbee, but ZigBee has it's own module since
% it's a fairly large part of this design

\subsubsection{Interface Board}

% This section is a little vague at the moment.
% Currently we're using Digi Interface Boards,
% but we may need to move to an Arduino if these
% boards lack an A/D converter pin. Haven't
% looked into it yet. In either case, whatever
% interface board we use will connect the
% measuring circuit to the radio. Might
% need diagram for this.
