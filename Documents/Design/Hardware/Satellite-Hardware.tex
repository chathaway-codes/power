\subsection{Communications Hardware}

For the communication between the Server and the Satellites,
we will be using the Xbee Series 2 Radio Modules.

\subsubsection{XBee Series 2 Radio Modules}

The XBee Series 2 Radio Module is configured to be running
the Zigbee mesh firmware. We chose this module because of it's
low current draw. When configured as an end device, it draws at
most 40 mA. In addition to it's low power draw, it also has a 
considerable indoor transmit range of 133 ft.

\subsubsection{Interface Board}

The Digi Interface board is the interface board that we will
be using to connect to the Xbee Series 2 Radio Modules. We 
chose this due to it's simplicity in communicating with the
Modules.
