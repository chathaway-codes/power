\chapter{Hardware Design Overview}

\section{Description}

The POW-R project is made of two main hardware components, the Server and the Satellites. The Server refers to the physical hardware from which the Display shall be served. It also acts as the data center for all Satellites associated to it, collecting data and administrating. The Satellites will talk over ZigBee specification to the one Zigbee module connected to the Server, and that one Zigbee module can talk to the Server over Universal Serial Bus (USB). Figure \ref{SystemOverview} shows the layout of the hardware system.

\section{The Satellites}
The Satellites are made up of two sets of hardware: Instruments for measuring and radios for communicating. The end product shall have casing around it, NEMA 5-15 sockets on one side, and prongs for a NEMA 5-15 male end on the other. However, it should be noted that prototyping will most likely involve all of the hardware being spread out on breadboards.
