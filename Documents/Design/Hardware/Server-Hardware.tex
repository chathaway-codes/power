\subsection{PC Hardware}

\subsubsection{Mainboard}
The Server's main hardware component is the mainboard, a SYS9400-ECX Developer\-Ready
Reference Platform. It's a small form\-factor, low\-power machine with the following specs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.6 GHz Intel Atom E6XX Series Processor
	\item 1 GB DDR2 RAM
	\item Roughly 6" by 4"
	\item Various connection interfaces:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2x SATA ports
		\item Header for Solid State Drive (SSD) power
		\item Ethernet port
		\item 5x USB ports
		\item General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pin header
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If for whatever reason, using this mainboard falls through, it should be noted that the
requirements for the Server hardware concern not just specifications, but interfaces as well.
In particular, this project requires at least Ethernet, 2 USB ports, a SATA port, and accessible
GPIO pins.
\subsubsection{Storage}
The Server's mainboard is connected via SATA to a 40GB SSD

\subsubsection{Power Supply}
An adapter rated for 12VDC @ 3A is used to connect the Server's board to mains electricity.
