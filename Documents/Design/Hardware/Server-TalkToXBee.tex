\subsection{Talking to the ZigBee Mesh}
This section is still about the Server, but the Satellites must be talked about here in
regards to how they communicate with the Server. The mesh network that the ZigBee modules
form (hereafter referred to as "the Mesh",) doesn't directly communicate with the Server
at all. This means that there's a clear separation between the computational / utility
hardware, and the measurement hardware.

The only point of the Mesh that the Server can communicate with is the "ZigBee Coordinator."
Every ZigBee mesh needs exactly one coordinator. Holding the title of "Master" in the
Mesh, it performs many tasks that will be discussed in the Satellite section, but in regards
to the Server, the coordinator stands out in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}

% The Server's only connection to the Mesh is
% the coordinator ZigBee. That's the Master
% node in this configuration. It talks over
% serial (USB) to the Server, sending data.
