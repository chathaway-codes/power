\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of this Document}
This document describes the high level design of all components of the Power Outlet Wireless Reporter (POW-R) system.

\section{Architectural Assumptions}
It is assumed that an entire system consists of one Server, and one or more Satellites.

\section{Summary of Requirements}
The POW-R project aims to produce a low cost, low powered, device that will allow home owners to track their power consumption on a per-device basis. 
The hope is that by allowing home owners to see where all their power is going, they can take steps to disable or replace the most inefficient offenders.

To accomplish the stated purpose, this project provides the following components:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Satellites
 \item The Server
 \item The Display
\end{itemize}

Each of these components have their own requirements. The basic summary of each one would be:

\subsection{Satellite Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ability to plug into standard NEMA 5-15 mains electrical outlets
 \item Two outlet sockets on the opposite side of the plugs (if it takes up two outlets, it should provide two outlets)
 \item Less than 5\% error on current and voltage reading
 \item Power draw less than 1W (Watt) per Satellite
 \item Broadcasts information up to 500m (meters)
 \item Transmits every 1.0 seconds
 \item Zigbee compatible
 \item Encrypted communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Physical Server inside the monitored building
 \item Runs on less than 10W (Watts)
 \item Hosts web server for Display
 \item Button to connect Satellites
 \item Ability to connect to the user's network
 \item Zigbee compatible
 \item Encrypted communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Display Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
 \item User Management
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Add users
	 \item Delete users
	 \item Modify user information
	 \item Modify user permissions
	\end{itemize}
 \item Group Management\savefootnote{opt}{Optional}
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Add groups
	 \item Delete groups
	 \item Modify groups
	 \item Group permissions
	\end{itemize}
 \item Device Management
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Add Devices
	 \item Disable Devices
		\begin{itemize}
	 		\item Does not include deleting Devices, since that would invalidate history
		\end{itemize}
	 \item Modify Devices
		\begin{itemize}
	 		\item Rename
	 		\item Change outlet association
		\end{itemize}
	 \item Device Groups\repeatfootnote{opt}
		\begin{itemize}
		 \item Device groups are logical groupings of Devices that can be 
		 	viewed as a single Device in the View Data section
		 \item Create Device groups
		 \item Delete Device groups
		 \item Modify Device groups
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
 \item Satellite Management
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Add Satellites
	 \item Remove Satellite
	% \item Changing the state of associated Satellite
	%\item Changing of the reporting frequency of the Satellite
	\end{itemize}
 \item View Data
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item View Device Power Consumption
		\begin{itemize}
		 \item Shows the user power consumption on a per-device (or device group) basis
		\end{itemize}
	 \item View Power Consumption Over Time
		\begin{itemize}
		 \item Shows the user power consumption over a specified range of time
		 \item Includes total and per-device power consumption
		\end{itemize}
	 \item View Device Cost Over Time\repeatfootnote{opt}
		\begin{itemize}
		 \item Shows the user the cost to run a device, or group of devices, over a specified time range
		 \item Shows the user a comparison of device costs over a specified range with a given interval
		 \item E.g. Show them the device cost every month for the past year
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
 \item Power Bill Guesstimator\repeatfootnote{opt}
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item View cost to run a specified device over a period of time in the future
	 \item View cost to run multiple devices over a period of time
	 \item View expected power bill if a device is added
	 \item Allow the user to specify cost of power for
	 \begin{itemize}
		\item Specific time ranges
		\item Specific power-usage ranges
		 \item E.g. Power cost the user \$0.08 per kW/hr for 
		 	the first 500 kW/hrs, and \$0.10 after that
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
 \item Factory reset\repeatfootnote{opt}
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Allow the user to reset the system to default settings via...
		\begin{itemize}
		 \item A form
		 \item A physical button located on the server
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
 \item Software upgrade\repeatfootnote{opt}
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Allow the user to upgrade the system to the newest software version
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
