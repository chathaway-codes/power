\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of this Document}
This document describes the low level design of all components of the \ac{POW-R} system.
The purpose of the  Design Document is to provide a description of the design of a system
fully enough to allow for software development to proceed with an understanding of what is to be
built and how it is expected to built.  This document provides information
necessary to provide description of the details for the software and system to be built.

\section{Scope}
This Design Document is for a base level system which will work as a proof of concept for
the use of building a system the provides a base level of functionality to show feasibility for large
scale production use.  This Design is focused on the base level system and critical parts
of the system.
