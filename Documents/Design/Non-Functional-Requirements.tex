\chapter{Non-functional Requirements}

\section{Summary of Requirements}
The POW-R project aims to produce a low cost, low powered, device that will allow home owners to track their power consumption on a per-device basis. 
The hope is that by allowing home owners to see where all their power is going, they can take steps to disable or replace the most inefficient offenders.

To accomplish the stated purpose, this project provides the following components:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Satellites
 \item The Server
 \item The Display
\end{itemize}

Each of these components have their own requirements. The basic summary of the non-functional requirements of each one would be:

\subsection{Satellite Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Display Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  \item
\end{itemize}
