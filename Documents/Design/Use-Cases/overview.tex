\chapter{Use Cases}

The following tasks are broken down into several simple steps. 
Although they do not account for things like "find the button to click", 
it is clear when a user is expected to click a button.\\

The "Actors" section describes the things that will play a role in this scenario. 
These can include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users
	\item The display
	\item The Satellite
\end{itemize}

The "Assumptions" section describes assumptions that are made for this scenario. 
These include things such as "User is logged in", or "Several Satellites are connected".\\

The "Procedure" describes the procedure that is taken to by the user to accomplish the goal. \\

The "Expected Outcome" is the ultimate goal. 
It is what the user expects to happen after they execute the procedure. 
These can be visual outputs, stored data, or even changes to the way the system behaves.
