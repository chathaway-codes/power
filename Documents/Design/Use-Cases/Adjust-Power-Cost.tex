\section{Adjust Power Cost}
This use case describes the process that a user would employ to change the cost-per-kilowatt-hour that the system uses to guesstimate the monthly power bill.

\subsubsection{Actors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User
	\item Display
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

The user is logged in and on the home page\\
The user has permission to change the kilowatt\/hr cost 

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The user clicks the "Settings" link from the navigation menu\\
The display presents the user with the settings panel, which includes a link to the "Adjust Power Cost" page\\
The user clicks the "Adjust Power Cost" link\\
The display presents the user with a page consisting of two columns of text boxes. The left column indicates the range for the cost, which is specified in the right column\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item The goal is to allow the user to say "My first 500 kW/hrs cost \$0.08, my next 1000 kW/hrs cost \$0.10, and everything after that costs \$0.12 per kW\/hr" 
\end{itemize}
The user adjusts the cost by changing the ranges or changing the costs\\
The user clicks a "Submit" button\\
The display shows the changed power costs

\subsubsection{Expected Outcome}

The display applies the changed power costs to all new calculations. 
Previous calculations shall remain unchanged, with assumption that costs just increased.
