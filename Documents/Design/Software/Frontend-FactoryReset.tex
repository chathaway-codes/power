\subsection{Factory Reset}

\subsubsection{Description}

This module describes the architecture of how the frontend will create pages that allow the user to reset the system back to factory default settings.
It will receive a basic framework for the web pages in HTML from the back end module and use Javascript to render the rest of the page. 
This front end module will be a page that will allow the user to initiate a Factory Reset.

\subsubsection{Program Flow}

When the user loads this page they will be presented with an option to perform a factory reset.
If they choose that option, this module will ask the user if they are sure and list the consiquences of doing so.
If the user still agrees, it will request a factory reset to be performed from the back end module.

\subsubsection{Potential Problems}

Making sure only administrators can reset the device to reduce the risk of accidentally breaking it.
Also may want to implement a method of backing up and restoring all of the data.
