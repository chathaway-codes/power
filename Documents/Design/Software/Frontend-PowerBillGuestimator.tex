\subsection{Power Bill Guestimator}

\subsubsection{Description}

This module describes the architecture of how the frontend will create pages that allow the user to view guestimates of their monthly power bill, in various scenarios.

It will receive a basic framework for the web pages in \ac{HTML} from the back end module and use Javascript to render the rest of the page. 
The pages will be created with a mix of \ac{HTML} and \ac{CSS} from the back end and heavy Javascript from this module. 

\subsubsection{Program Flow}

When the user would like to estimate a power bill they first have to select what devices they want to view and for what time period.
With that information selected, this module asks the backend for the power cost data for said devices.

When the user is modifiying the utility company rates they will be presented with a wizard that ill guide them through inputting them.
This wizard will ask them several questions about how the utility company charges for power and will give data to the backend accordingly.


\subsubsection{Potential Problems}

One potential problem is having a utility company have rates change in a way we did not anticipate.
One other issue is not having rates defined before trying to calculate the bill.
