\subsection{Frontend - View Data}

\subsubsection{Description}

This module describes the architecture of how the frontend will create pages that allow the user to view various pieces of data in various formats.

The View Data front end is responsible for providing the user with data regarding each device and device group. 
It will provide three separate graphs and tables with data specified by the user; 
Device Power Consumption, Monthly Power Consumption, and Power Consumption Over Time. 
This module will be using jqPlot to render the graphs on the web page. 
This will allow the back end to provide the data for the content and the front end to plot the graphs as needed. 


\subsubsection{Program Flow}

From the Home page the user will be able to select which graph or table they would like to view.  
These graphs and tables provide the user with information pertaining to the Devices specified and within the time-frame selected.  

\subsubsection{Data Flow}

This module requests data for the graphs and tables from the back end through the REST API. 
It receives a response and renders the graphs and tables with the data provided. 

\subsubsection{Potential Problems}

The main sources of concern with this module have been stated previously in Section 3.5. 
We will be facing a large learning curve as we must familiarize ourselves with the software we will be using, such as jqPlot. 
There is also the problem where some users will not have Javascript supported in their browsers. 
This will keep them from being able to view any of the information presented by this module using Javascript or jqPlot. 
These problems have been addressed previously.
