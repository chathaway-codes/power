\subsection{Satellite}

\subsubsection{Description}

This module describes the architecture of how the back end will manage features related to managing Satellites. 

The Satellite Management back end is in control of maintaining the information in the database pertaining to Satellites. 
The back end will also generate the framework for the web pages. 
It will pass the basic form of the Satellite Management page to the front end to be filled in with additional formatting. 

\subsubsection{Program Flow}

The back end Satellite Management module will be activated by a request from the front end Satellite Management. 
This module will complete the request by adding information to the \ac{SQL} database or querying said database for specific data. 

\subsubsection{Data Flow}

The Data Flow will behave in much the same manner as the Program Flow. 
The back end Satellite Management module will receive data from the Satellite Management front end via the \ac{REST} \ac{API}. 
This includes data that needs to be changed in the database, and requests for data. 
This module will then modify or query the database as needed, 
returning the requested data or a confirmation of modification to the front end through the \ac{REST} \ac{API}. 

\subsubsection{Sub-modules}
Communication with the Satellites:\\
This modules serves as an interface and a form listener. 
It will receive \ac{POST}ed commands for dispatch to the ZigBee network via a serial-port connected ZigBee. 
It will also receive the incoming data from the ZigBee network and store it in the Database. 
The data will consist of the current and voltage readings from each Satellite on the network. 

\subsubsection{Objects}

The Satellite module consists of the following objects:

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Database Description}

Figure \ref{img:S_Satellite_Device} describes the database for the power\_data module. 
This schema is here because it is so closely related to the Satellite module. 
The fields are expanded upon below.

\paragraph{satellite}

\begin{itemize}
 \item id - This is the primary key for this device. It will be indexed, and will be the primary means of updating and deleting objects.
 \item serial\_number - This, combined the the outlet, form a unique key. This field will be used to identify the outlet to the user.
 \item outlet - This field represents the outlet on the satellite. 
 \item device\_id - This field is a foreign key to the device that is associated to this outlet. It will be used to log the data to the appropriate devices when it is inserted into the power\_data module.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{img:S_Power_Data_Device} describes the database for the Power\_Data module. The fields are expanded upon below.

\paragraph{data}

\begin{itemize}
 \item id - This is the primary key for this device. It will be indexed, and will be the primary means of updating and deleting objects.
 \item device\_id - This is a foreign key relating this piece of data to a device. This will be index, and used to aggregate appropriate data.
 \item timestamp - This field represents the time that this data was put into the database.
 \item watt - This field represents the total wattage being drawn by the device over interval. It is a product of the voltage and amperage, and amperage can be calculated from it.
 \item avg\_volt - This is the average voltage pulled by the device over interval.
 \item interval - This is the length of time that was measured. It will be used to average the voltage and amperage
\end{itemize}
