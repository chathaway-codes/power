 \begin{itemize}
  \item Went more-or-less according to plan
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item We switched away from Backbone.js and iCanHaz because AngularJS covered both domains
   \item We didn't use Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) because very few libraries supported it
   \item There were some small modifications to the REST API to make it more compatible with the world
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Biggest software problem was the complexity of the setup
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Because of the number of libraries and frameworks, it was difficult to do development in Windows
   \item We developed two solutions; a completely isolated Python development environment, and a VirtualBox for people with Windows
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{itemize}

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Some things didn't make it to the final product for a variety of reasons
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Adding satellites was ditched because it was too confusing for an end user
   \item The power-bill-guestimater was ditched because it would be impossible to accurately track all power consumption, thus leading to incorrect guestimates
   \item The user-management stuff was simplified because we don't need a complex permission system
  \end{itemize}
  \item Some things were added
  \begin{itemize}
   \item We used Intro.JS to create a "help" feature in our website
   \item We added a JS compressor to keep the codebase small when delivered to the client
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
